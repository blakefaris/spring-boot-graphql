= Introduction

With the focus of defining effective, efficient and maintainable domain models, the model service is designed to provide a canonical model to consumers.
In an effort to standardize an agreed upon data definition, the domain models will be brand agnostic.  The goal is to create domain models that represent
the actual domain, not the underlying data structures.  With all this in mind, the domain design should allow for robust consumption and extensibility.
